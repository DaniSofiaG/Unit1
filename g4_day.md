This means that although we create around 1 quadrillion pieces of information in a lifetime, we are not capable of recalling all that information, only 15% to 22%. According to Stanford medical Dr Bruce Goldman the adult human brain can store up to 2.5 million gigabytes. If we wanted to store all that information inside a 4Gb USB, we would need around 625,000 of them. If we wanted to download 22% of it that would equal 550000 gigabytes, which would be 137500 4Gb USB.
